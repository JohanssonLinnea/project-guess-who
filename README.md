Project Guess Who

This project is a board game called Guess Who. A randomly selected person are set as the secret when the game starts and to find out who it is you select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.

## The problem

The code is currently not working correctly, nothing happens when you click on the "Find out" button. IÂ´ve tried looking in the console and used chat gpt to try to debug the code but no success so far. If I had more time than maybe I would figure it out.
